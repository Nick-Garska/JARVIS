# J.A.R.V.I.S
JARVIS is a Flutter-based phone app AI assistant designed to help people handle all their daily tasks like a human assistant, allowing them to focus more on important matters. The software may include, but is not limited to, summarizing and sending emails, assisting users in answering and making phone calls, and helping with the payment of utilities and insurance bills, among other tasks. Just as the name JARVIS suggests, we aim to make this software a comprehensive AI assistant like JARVIS in Iron Man, helping Tony Stark solve problems and manage daily activities.
